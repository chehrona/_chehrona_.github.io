<p>Thanks for stopping by my blog. In this blog you will find awesome tips and tricks about school survival and ideas for self-actualization. I am not a professional or anything, but I am a student. So you will get insights into challenges and joys being a student that I have tried first hand. A bit about my background, I am a recent college graduate, and I majored in Biochemistry (hardest possible major out there). I was an international student in The United States, and decided that I wanted more adventure. Thus, I am currently a Masterâ€™s student living the dream in Montreal, continuing to explore the awesomeness of science. I hope you enjoy reading my stories and I hope they will inspire you to study abroad, as well!</p>
